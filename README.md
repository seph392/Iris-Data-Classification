# Iris-Data-Classification
<br> This is my first program with Python using Machine Learning. Here, I try to compare multiple models and find Support Vector Classifier work the best.
<br>
<br>Comparing Model for Kfold Cross-validation technique and StratifiedKfold Cross-validation Technique.
<br>Both are sampling techniques, and the only difference is StratifiedKfold is representative of the distribution of the dataset, whereas Kfold is a random sampling technique.

<br><b> Feature Selection
<br>Using Scatter-Matrix, I try to get an understanding of correlation between features taking 2 at a time.
